StackHawk is an application security testing tool built for developers. With powerful automation and integration capabilities, StackHawk gives engineers the ability to find and fix security vulnerabilities on every merge.  ## Getting Started  To make requests to the StackHawk API, you will first need an **API Key** from the StackHawk platform. That will be used to request an **access token**, which is used to authorize requests made to the StackHawk API.  Use of the StackHawk API will require a [StackHawk account](https://auth.stackhawk.com) and an organization with sufficient permissions.  From the StackHawk platform, under [Settings > API Keys](https://app.stackhawk.com/settings/apikeys) create a new API Key. These secrets are long-lived, so store this value in a secure fashion.  ### Authorization  Requests made to the StackHawk API server are authorized following the [OAuth2.0 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/)  To get an access token, make a request to `GET /api/v1/auth/login` and provide the user apikey through the `X-ApiKey` request header. This route will then return an access token that can authenticate further API requests. This token can then be used to authenticate subsequent requests, using the `authorization: Bearer` header.  For more information, see the **Api Authentication** section.  ### Rate Limiting  Api calls are ratelimited, with at most 180 requests per minute.  ## StackHawk Api Standards  ### Client Errors  API Calls that fail due to client input will return 4xx status code.  #### `401 Unauthorized` The server doesn't think you should be making this request.  This error is intentionally vague for security purposes, but any of the following could cause it:  - no authorization was provided - authorization has expired - authorization is insufficient for the requested resource  #### `404 Not Found`  The route or resource does not exist.  #### `400 Bad Request` The server could not process this request, although it may have tried. The JSON reponse body `message` will include details on what input was invalid.  ### Pagination and Sorting  Listing API routes will return resources in a paginated fashion. Paginated requests follow a pattern of taking the following optional path parameters:  * `pageToken`: a string incrementing count of pages in the pagination, starting from '0' * `pageSize`: the number of elements to request in the page, defaults to 10 * `sortField`: sorts the listed resource by an approved field, defaults to sorting by resource name * `sortDir`: either 'asc' or 'desc', defaults ascending  The responseBody of these API routes will additionally include two fields:  * `nextPageToken`: a string indicating the next `pageToken` to pass in for the next page of results with this request * `totalCount`: the total number of resources the query can paginate through  ## Questions?
