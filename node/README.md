# Sample StackHawk Node App

This sample consists of two directories:
  - [stack_hawk_public_api](stack_hawk_public_api/) - A node package generated by `openapi-generator generate -i openapi-v3-public.json -g javascript -o .`
  - [node-sample-app](node-sample-app/) - A sample node application that uses the generated module `stack_hawk_public_api`

The `build.sh` script is an example of how to build the generated node package and use it locally in a node app.
